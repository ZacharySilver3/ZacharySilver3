Hello! My name is Zachary Silver. As of September 1 2024, I am 26 years old and have finally decided to get serious about learning how to code. 
For now, this is just a side hobby I am enjoying. I would eventually love to become a software developer, but that goal will be decided based on how much I enjoy my new hobby.
Currently, I work at a bank and have made a career in automation by using Alteryx. 
I studied actuarial sciences at the University of Illinois, so I have a very number based brain.
Thanks for coming and checking out my github. Excited to watch my programming skills take off!
